# QNet-MTP


## TODO
[x] add uptottime only in purify
[y] E(Y) calculated before the ent_swap
[x] Calculate SKR using E(Y) and r_secure from Prateek's thing
[x] Average at rho the end of the thing.

l0 = distance / number of parameters

Envelope - take best perfroming l_0, N
For different l_0, very different N
distance resolution 
10 - 100 km - it is 1km each
100 - 1000 km - it is 10 km each
1000 - 10000 km - it is 100 km each

parallely chalao
Using Distributed.jl - read this

- Check Stefan's secure key implementation

- Gate time later









## New TODO
- Generate the plots in julia
- Look into missing n=128 in bottom row of graphs
- Get more data points across the board
- Find the bounties

- Plot differences between values I have, and values Prateek has
- Error bars for each data point

- Start writing a Latex paper
- Start working on presentation (perhaps with animation) (perhaps a QuantumSavory tutorial)
